DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED:
Music is a universal language that has withstood the test of time and is present in nearly all areas of the globe. Spotify is one of the top music platforms in the U.S. One thing that’s always interested me about music is how different the songs on the top of charts are; when I listen to Spotify’s top 50, I can expect to hear anything from pop to country or from rap to childrens within the span of 15 minutes.
 
INSPIRATION: A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data.
 
●  	Plotly dashboard with multiple filter options.
●  	One plot with an interactive axis to change between some of the song characteristics.
